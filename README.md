# Sports_Analysis

This repository will hold any code and additional information that I use for sports analytics.

**UPDATE 04 Aug 2025:** Running the `MLB Season v2.R` script for the current season. Minor update due to Athletics baseball team moving to Las Vegas.  ESPN data does not have an abbreviation for the team yet, so I used "LV", similar to the Raiders (NFL).  
Also working on a Python equivalent.  Work will be done using R (RStudio & Positron) and Python (Positron).  
Also added the package `openxlsx2` since its predecessor `openxlsx` has been depricated by its developer.

**UPDATE 23 Aug 2024:** Added a new R script, `MLB Season v2.R` which updates the previous script with further cleaning of team names, specifically addressing notations next to team names for the upcoming post-season play.  It also includes some modification to the projected win-loss values used in previous scripts.

**UPDATE 06 Aug 2024:** Added a new R script, `MLB Season v1.R` which updates the previous scripts by cleaning up the issue with team names and abbreviations.

Thanks,
Rich
