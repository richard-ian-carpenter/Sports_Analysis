This repository will hold any code and additional information that I use for sports analytics.

**UPDATE 23 Aug 2024:** Added a new R script, `MLB Season v2.R` which updates the previous script with further cleaning of team names, specifically addressing notations next to team names for the upcoming post-season play.  It also includes some modification to the projected win-loss values used in previous scripts.

**UPDATE 06 Aug 2024:** Added a new R script, `MLB Season v1.R` which updates the previous scripts by cleaning up the issue with team names and abbreviations.

Thanks,
Rich
